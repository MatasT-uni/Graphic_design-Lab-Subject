# Graphic Design Lab

**Graphic Design Lab** is a project developed in C++ that delves into the core principles of computer graphics. The project is designed to provide a practical understanding of graphic design techniques, including rendering, transformations, and object manipulation, using the C++ programming language.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a solid foundation in computer graphics by implementing a series of graphic design tools and algorithms. The project covers a wide range of topics essential for graphic design and computer graphics, including:

- **Rendering Techniques**: Implementing basic rendering algorithms to draw shapes and objects on the screen.
- **Geometric Transformations**: Applying transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling to objects within a 2D or 3D space.
- **Object Manipulation**: Creating and modifying objects through user input or predefined parameters.
- **Graphics Pipeline**: Understanding and simulating the graphics pipeline, from vertex processing to pixel rendering.

## Key Features

- **Shape Rendering**: Drawing and rendering basic shapes (e.g., lines, circles, polygons) using C++.
- **Transformation Operations**: Implementing operations like translation, rotation, and scaling to manipulate graphic objects.
- **Interactive Graphics**: Developing interactive tools that allow users to create and modify graphic objects.
- **Custom Algorithms**: Crafting custom algorithms to optimize the rendering process and improve visual output.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- **C++ Compiler**: A modern C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC) that supports C++11 or later.
- **Graphics Library**: Depending on the implementation, you may need to install additional graphics libraries such as OpenGL, SDL, or SFML.


### Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- Draw shapes on the screen using predefined commands.
- Apply geometric transformations to objects.
- Experiment with different rendering techniques.

## Future Work

- **3D Graphics**: Extending the project to support 3D object rendering and transformations.
- **Advanced Rendering Techniques**: Implementing shading, lighting, and texture mapping.
- **User Interface**: Creating a user-friendly interface for easier interaction with graphic objects.
